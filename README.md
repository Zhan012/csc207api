# Data Analysis Project

## Problem Domain:
**Data Analysis**: In today's age of big data, analyzing and interpreting vast amounts of information is crucial for numerous sectors, from finance to healthcare. Our team is focused on the domain of data analysis, aiming to simplify and automate the process of regression and classification-based analysis of data sets.

## Application Description:
We are developing an application that can take in datasets, preferably in CSV format, and conduct **Regression** or **Classification** analysis based on the user's input. Users will be able to specify the response variable (y) and predictor (x) and choose their desired model, such as a simple linear model initially.

For **Regression Analysis**, our application will predict the output for 'y' based on the provided data and chosen model.

For **Classification Analysis**, our application will classify the data and return predictions in binary form (0 or 1).

### Project Direction:
While there are tools and software available for data analysis, our focus is to create an easy-to-use API interface that automates the process and provides accurate results without the steep learning curve often associated with data analysis tools.

## API Documentation:

## API Tool Test:
A screenshot of our API being tested on tools like Postman or Hoppscotch will be placed here.
*Note: You can upload the image to an image hosting site like Imgur and link it here for easy visualization.*

## Java Code Example Output:
```java
Given the input parameters:
- **Predictors**: 
   - Age
   - Gender

- **Method**: 
   - Linear Regression

The API provided the following prediction:
Height Prediction: 175cm
